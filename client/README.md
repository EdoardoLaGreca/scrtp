# client (scrtp)

You can find everything about building and running the client in the [README file](../README.md) in the repo root directory, so I will not bother writing it again.

All the source files begin with a little description of their purpose.

The `scrtp` file is a POSIX shell script which controls all the other little programs. So if you want to run the entire client, start that script.

The `reqbins` file contains all the required binary files in order to correctly work.
