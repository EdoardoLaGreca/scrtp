# scrtp

Screen teleport - low latency remote screen control.

## Development

I chose to use Go to write both client and server because of the ease with which
the problem of concurrency can be solved.

Using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for commit
messages is preferable but not strictly required.
