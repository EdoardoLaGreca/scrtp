# sizable updates (Dec 21, 2022)

## 1. Breaking monoliths into pieces

The main idea is to revisit the whole project and change its structure to adhere more to the [UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).

The first step is to break monolithic programs into smaller ones which, as described in the UNIX philosophy, do one thing and do it well. Then, [anonymous pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_pipe) created by shell scripts orchestrate these smaller programs, providing means of communication.

Although this means changing most of the code (some of which took hours to write, test, debug, and correct), it also allows improvements in crucial areas. Complexity, maintainability, ease of upgrade, stability, and modularity are some of them.

Luckily, it is possible to recycle some code. Otherwise, I would delete everything and start again from scratch.

## 2. Windows support drop

Sadly for you but happily for me, I am dropping even the most remote possibility of official Windows support. If you want it to run on Windows, make a port or use [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).

## 3. External dependency reduction

The new codebase is not going to use any external library. All the functions come from either the [ANSI C standard library](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Standard_libraries#ANSI_C_library_header_files) or the [POSIX library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_POSIX_library). The only exceptions are the UI client libraries for spawning windows, drawing into them, and handling input. That is the case of [XCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCB) for Xorg and [libwayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/apb.html) for Wayland.

External programs count as dependencies as well. The goal is to reduce those as much as possible.

## 4. Usage of Conventional Commits

Today using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) style becomes required for the current and all the following commits. Related sections in the project documentation are going to undergo this change.

Previous commits are not in the Conventional Commits style, but that is not a problem since most of the code is to be rewritten.
